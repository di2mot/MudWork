Маленькая кнсольная програмка для расчёта реологических параметров бурового раствора

Будет включать в себя модели:

Bingham Plastic Model (bh)—This model describes fluids in which
the shear stress shear rate ratio is linear
once a specific shear stress has been exceeded.

Power Law (pl) —The Power Law is used to describe the flow of
shear thinning or pseudoplastic drilling fluids.

Herschel-Bulkley Model (hb) —Also called the “modified” power law and
yield-pseudoplastic model, the Herschel-Bulkley model is used to describe
the flow of pseudoplastic drilling fluids which require a yield stress
to initiate flow. Defoult model
